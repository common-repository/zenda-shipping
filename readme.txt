Show and collect a landed cost at checkout, including tax and duty
 
== Description ==
 

With Zenda Checkout, you can display a fully landed cost right in your checkout page, including all import taxes and duties.

Unlike other shipping services that require customers to pay taxes and duties upon delivery, Zenda allows your customers to pay these fees upfront, eliminating surprise extra fees and delivery delays.

This app displays Zenda as a shipping method on your checkout page. Your customer will see Zenda's shipping cost, with a breakdown of all import taxes and duties for their order. This gives your customers a more transparent buying experience while helping you wave goodbye to cart abandonment and customs issues.
